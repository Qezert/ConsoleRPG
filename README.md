- Plenty of **unique zones**, each with their own cast of monsters to encounter.
- Multiple **zone bosses**, who guard entry to the next zone.
- Lots of different monsters to fight.
- Many different **spells and abilities**, allowing you to approach combat in many different ways.
- Strategic gameplay, balancing farming with progression.
- A quick and simple format, allowing you to play the game **when you want, where you want**.

# Installation guide

The game is currently in a pre-alpha state.
This means that you will have to clone the repository, and build and run the project yourself.

Future versions will have bundled releases for you to download and run.

As soon as you run the project, the game is already running. Just follow the instructions in your terminal, and you will be slaying demons in no time!
